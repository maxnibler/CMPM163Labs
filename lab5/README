Using the base scene given I was curious what would happen if I used the random
function to effectively slow down the particle effect without editting the particle
values themselves. This created a stuttering effect that I actually kind of liked 
as it made the partcles appear as though they were not moving at a consistent speed.
Then I wanted to create a delayed effect so I added a count variable and only applied
acceleration to the x velocity until it had counted up. This had an unintended effect
of creating a concentrated disk of partcles that only had x acceleration while the
rest moved normally. I liked the result so I added the finishing touches of applying
the color and sprite from part a to make it more visually appealing.
